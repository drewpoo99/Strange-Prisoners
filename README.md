# Strange-Prisoners
A game built in Java as my Programming 2 final project. 


A game built in Java as my Programming 2 final project. It has some errors, but it was pretty neat to build at the time. The name Strange Prisoners is inspired by Platos Allegory of the Cave, even though the game has nothing to do with that writing. Perhaps that will be my next project.
